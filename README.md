# boot-check

[Boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot) tasks to check, analyze and inspect Clojure/Script code.

It relies on universe tested [kibit](https://github.com/jonase/kibit),
[eastwood](https://github.com/jonase/eastwood), [yagni](https://github.com/venantius/yagni), [bikeshed](https://github.com/dakrone/lein-bikeshed) and other titans.

## Why

To be able to reach out to multiple code analyzers as well as compose them as [Boot tasks](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Tasks):

```clojure
(require '[tolitius.boot-check :as check])
```

```clojure
(deftask check-sources []
  (set-env! :source-paths #{"src" "test"})
  (comp
    (check/with-yagni)
    (check/with-eastwood)
    (check/with-kibit)
    (check/with-bikeshed)))
```

You can choose the tools (tasks) that apply, i.e. use one or several, and `boot-check` will do the rest: integration with analyzers, dependencies, reports, etc..

All these tasks will run inside [Boot pods](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Pods).

## Kibit

[kibit](https://github.com/jonase/kibit) is a static code analyzer for Clojure, ClojureScript, cljx and other Clojure variants.

### From Command Line

To check your code directly from shell:

```bash
$ boot check/with-kibit
latest report from kibit.... [You Rock!]
```

In case there are [problems](test/test/with_kibit.clj):

```clojure
(defn when-vs-if []
  (if 42 42 nil))

(defn vec-vs-into []
  (into [] 42))
```

kibit will show suggestions:

```clojure
$ boot check/with-kibit
At ../.boot/cache/tmp/../fun/boot-check/yeg/-grrwi1/test/with_kibit.clj:4:
Consider using:
  (when 42 42)
instead of:
  (if 42 42 nil)

At ../.boot/cache/tmp/../fun/boot-check/yeg/-grrwi1/test/with_kibit.clj:7:
Consider using:
  (vec 42)
instead of:
  (into [] 42)

WARN: kibit found some problems:

{:problems #{{:expr (if 42 42 nil), :line 4, :column 3, :alt (when 42 42)}
             {:expr (into [] 42), :line 7, :column 3, :alt (vec 42)}}}
```

### From within "build.boot"

To use `boot-check` tasks within `build.boot` is easy:

```clojure
(require '[tolitius.boot-check :as check])

(deftask check-sources []
  (set-env! :source-paths #{"src" "test"})
  (comp
    (check/with-kibit)))
```

### Help

```shell
$ boot check/with-kibit -h
Static code analyzer for Clojure, ClojureScript, cljx and other Clojure variants.

This task will run all the kibit checks within a pod.

At the moment it takes no arguments, but behold..! it will. (files, rules, reporters, etc..)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print this help info.
  -t, --throw-on-errors  throw an exception if the check does not pass
```

## Yagni

[yagni](https://github.com/venantius/yagni) is a static code analyzer that helps you find unused code in your applications and libraries.

### From Command Line

To check your code directly from shell:

```shell
$ boot check/with-yagni
latest report from yagni.... [You Rock!]
```

if Yagni finds [unused code](test/test/with_yagni.clj) it will gladly report the news:

```shell
WARN: could not find any references to the following:

tolitius.yagni/check
test.with-yagni/func-the-second
test.with-yagni/other-func
tolitius.yagni/report
test.with-kibit/vec-vs-into
test.with-yagni/-main

WARN: the following have references to them, but their parents do not:

tolitius.yagni/yagni-deps
tolitius.yagni/pp
test.with-kibit/when-vs-if
test.with-yagni/func
test.with-yagni/notafunc
```

### From within "build.boot"

To use `boot-check` tasks within `build.boot` is easy:

```clojure
(require '[tolitius.boot-check :as check])

(deftask check-sources []
  (set-env! :source-paths #{"src" "test"})
  (comp
    (check/with-yagni)))
```

### Help

```shell
$ boot check/with-yagni -h
Static code analyzer for Clojure that helps you find unused code in your applications and libraries.

This task will run all the yagni checks within a pod.

Options:
  -h, --help             Print this help info.
  -o, --options OPTIONS  OPTIONS sets yagni options EDN map.
  -t, --throw-on-errors  throw an exception if the check does not pass
```

#### Yagni entry points

Yagni works by searching your codebase from an initial set of entrypoints. As libraries, multi-main programs, and certain other types of projects either tend to have no `:main` or many entrypoint methods, you can instead, optionally, enumerate a `list of entrypoints` for your project in options:

```clojure
(check/with-yagni :options {:entry-points ["test.with-yagni/-main"
                                           "test.with-yagni/func-the-second"
                                           42]})))
```

check out the [example](https://github.com/tolitius/boot-check/blob/master/build.boot#L21-L23) in the `boot.build` of this project.

## Eastwood

[eastwood](https://github.com/jonase/eastwood) is a Clojure [lint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) tool that uses the [tools.analyzer](https://github.com/clojure/tools.analyzer) and [tools.analyzer.jvm](https://github.com/clojure/tools.analyzer.jvm) libraries to inspect namespaces and report possible problems.

### From Command Line

To check your code directly from shell:

```shell
$ boot check/with-eastwood
latest report from eastwood.... [You Rock!]
```
if eastwood finds [problems](test/test/with_eastwood.clj) it will gladly report the news:

```shell
== Linting test.with-kibit ==
... /test/with_kibit.clj:4:3: constant-test: Test expression is always logical true or always logical false: 42 in form (if 42 42 nil)

== Linting test.with-eastwood ==
... /test/with_eastwood.clj:5:8: def-in-def: There is a def of a nested inside def nested-def

== Warnings: 2 (not including reflection warnings)  Exceptions thrown: 0

WARN: eastwood found some problems ^^^
```

### From within "build.boot"

To use `boot-check` tasks within `build.boot` is easy:

```clojure
(require '[tolitius.boot-check :as check])

(deftask check-sources []
  (set-env! :source-paths #{"src" "test"})
  (comp
    (check/with-eastwood)))
```

### Help

```shell
$ boot check/with-eastwood -h
Clojure lint tool that uses the tools.analyzer and tools.analyzer.jvm libraries to inspect namespaces and report possible problems

This task will run all the eastwood checks within a pod.

At the moment it takes no arguments, but behold..! it will. (linters, namespaces, etc.)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print this help info.
  -t, --throw-on-errors  throw an exception if the check does not pass
```

## Bikeshed

[bikeshed](https://github.com/dakrone/lein-bikeshed) is a Clojure "checkstyle/pmd" tool that designed to tell you your code is bad, and that you should feel bad.

### From Command Line

To check your code directly from shell:

```shell
$ boot check/with-bikeshed
latest report from bikeshed.... [You Rock!]
```
if bikeshed finds problems it will gladly report the news:

```shell
Checking for lines longer than 80 characters.

### From within "build.boot"

To use `boot-check` tasks within `build.boot` is easy:

```clojure
(require '[tolitius.boot-check :as check])

(deftask check-sources []
  (set-env! :source-paths #{"src" "test"})
  (comp
    (check/with-bikeshed)))
```

### Help

```shell
$ boot check/with-bikeshed -h

This task is backed by 'lein-bikeshed' which is designed to tell you your code is bad, and that you should feel bad

This task will run bikeshed checks within a pod.

Options:
  -h, --help             Print this help info.
  -o, --options OPTIONS  OPTIONS sets bikeshed options EDN map.
  -t, --throw-on-errors  throw an exception if the check does not pass
```

### Bikeshed Options

Bikeshed takes some options:

```clojure
(check/with-bikeshed :options {:check? #{:long-lines}
                               :verbose true
                               :max-line-length 42})
```

or

```
$ boot check/with-bikeshed -o '{:check? #{:long-lines :trailing-whitespace :var-redefs :bad-methods :name-collisions}}'
```

check out the [example](https://github.com/tolitius/boot-check/blob/master/build.boot#L34-L36) in the boot.build of this project.

## Handling Errors

All tasks (i.e. for kibit, yagni, eastwood, bikeshed, etc.) accept an optional flag:

```
-t, --throw-on-errors  throw an exception if the check does not pass
```

that if set will report all the problems found with the task, and then throw an exception.

For some cases when You want to handle exceptions for all code checkers used in your boot pipeline (not stop after first exception) You can use task called 'throw-on-errors'. This is because when using flag on particular checker task - exception will be thrown and pipeline will be not continued. This is not perfect approach as long as You still may want to report all errors from other 'pending' checkers. Task 'throw-on-errors' provided at the end of the pipeline will take all possible issues (persisted as part of boot input files) and throw exception which contains those issues under :causes map key. So by using 'throw-on-errors' task You can get all errors aggregated in single exception, and You are not preventing pipeline execution until You use that task - so You can achieve reporting for all checkers If You wish, and after that throw aggregated exception.

Here are some examples:

```clojure
boot.user=> (set-env! :source-paths #{"src" "test"})
```

### Kibit Exceptions

```clojure
boot.user=> (boot (check/with-kibit "-t"))
 ... reporting problems here then throws:

clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: kibit checks fail

boot.user=> *e
#error {
 :cause "kibit checks fail"
 :data {:causes ({:expr (if 42 42 nil), :line 4, :column 3, :alt (when 42 42)} {:expr (into [] 42), :line 7, :column 3, :alt (vec 42)})}
 ...}
```

### Yagni Exceptions

```clojure
boot.user=> (boot (check/with-yagni "-t"))
 ... reporting problems here then throws:

clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: yagni checks fail

boot.user=> *e
#error {
 :cause "yagni checks fail"
 :data {:causes {:no-refs #{tolitius.boot-check/with-eastwood test.with-yagni/other-func tolitius.boot-check/with-yagni tolitius.boot-check/with-bikeshed tolitius.boot-check/with-kibit test.with-eastwood/nested-def test.with-kibit/vec-vs-into test.with-eastwood/always-true}, :no-parent-refs #{tolitius.boot.helper/make-pod-pool tolitius.boot.helper/fileset->paths tolitius.checker.yagni/yagni-deps tolitius.checker.yagni/entry-points-file tolitius.checker.bikeshed/bikeshed-deps tolitius.checker.yagni/create-entry-points test.with-kibit/when-vs-if tolitius.checker.yagni/check tolitius.checker.yagni/pp tolitius.boot.helper/tmp-dir-paths test.with-eastwood/a tolitius.checker.yagni/report tolitius.checker.yagni/check-graph tolitius.checker.kibit/kibit-deps tolitius.checker.eastwood/check tolitius.checker.kibit/check tolitius.boot-check/pod-deps tolitius.boot-check/with-throw test.with-yagni/func tolitius.checker.bikeshed/check tolitius.checker.eastwood/eastwood-deps tolitius.boot-check/bootstrap}}}
 ...}
```


### Eastwood Exceptions

```clojure
boot.user=> (boot (check/with-eastwood "-t"))
 ... reporting problems here then throws:

clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: eastwood checks fail

boot.user=> *e
#error {
 :cause "eastwood checks fail"
 :data {:causes {:err nil, :warning-count 12, :exception-count 0}}
 ...}
```

In case of Eastwood warnings are not returned, just their number of them. They are however reported (printed) as found.

### Bikeshed Exceptions

```clojure
boot.user=> (boot (check/with-bikeshed "-t"))
 ... reporting problems here then throws:

boot.user=> *e
#error {
 :cause "bikeshed checks fail"
 :data {:causes true}
 ...}
```

In case of Bikeshed, no errors / warnings are retured, since its own internal checks just return true/false values. But the exception is raised nevertheless to indicate that some checks have failed.

## Reporting

As long as standard console output may be sometimes difficult to read - boot-check contains reporting task 'boot-check-report' which will generate html report from all selected code checkers. With 'boot-check-report' task You can generate default hiccup powered html report using option switch like this one (this is also default reporter when option is not provided):

```clojure
(check/boot-check-report :options {:reporter :html})
```
Or You can register your own reporter. This is possible because boot-check-report internally delegates reporting to specific reporter using multimethod dispatch. For new reporter just implement this method:

```clojure
(defmethod tolitius.core.reporting/report :custom-reporter-key-goes-here [issues options])
```
Also You need to require your namespace containing above defmethod to evaluate it (probably in build.boot).

Look at how typical pipeline with reporting enabled (and additional throw-on-errors task) can look like:

```clojure
(deftask check-with-report []
  (comp
    (test-kibit)
    (test-eastwood)
    (test-yagni)
    (test-bikeshed)
    (check/boot-check-report :options {:reporter :html})
    (check/throw-on-errors)))
```
